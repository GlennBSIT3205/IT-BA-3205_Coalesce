# A Comparative Analysis between Pre-Pandemic and Today's Education in the Philippines

**Introduction** 

The world has altered since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. It has had a significant impact on the worldwide economic, political, and cultural environment due to the virus's unique characteristics, mainly how it spreads.  Furthermore, state-imposed community quarantine, lockdowns, and curfews have exacerbated poverty and discrimination in many parts of the world, not only because COVID-19 appears to affect poorer communities more than wealthy communities, but also because state-imposed measures to control the virus's spread, primarily by imposing community quarantine, lockdowns, and curfews in many parts of the world.

To meet the demands of students in a new digital environment, higher education institutions need to rethink how their students interact with each other and how classes are organized. Course syllabus and prerequisites need revision and adjustment when the focus shifts to alternative or remote teaching methods, including synchronous and asynchronous delivery. Online learning management systems enable educators to deliver courses with real-time interaction among students and teachers, wherever they are located. Text messaging, Email, and Facebook Messenger have been used in classrooms when computers were inaccessible or the Internet was unreliable. Several colleges halted online/remote classes because of the disparity in student socioeconomic levels, making them unworkable for some students.

Education is essential in almost every country around the world. Even though each country has its educational system, most countries have a similar concept or equivalent qualifications. The education system in the Philippines is unique in that it incorporates influences from its colonial history. The colonization of Malaysia, China, Spain, and America has had a significant impact on the education system in the Philippines. However, much of the country's current educational system is modeled after American educational practices. In the Philippines, a thirteen-year education is required by law. These thirteen years, known as the K-12 program, lasted from kindergarten to grade twelve. Following that, students can choose whether or not to pursue further education. The Department of Education (DepEd) is in charge of primary (pre-university) education in the Philippines. The Commission on Higher Education is in charge of tertiary and graduate education, while the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is responsible for technical-vocational courses and middle education.

Even before COVID-19 hit, causing troubles for millions of families, the country's financial situation was one of the primary reasons for the Philippines' expanding education challenges. Furthermore, more children, teens, and adults are falling behind due to unequal access to learning. In the future, such difficulties may have far-reaching consequences. Now, we will look at the present situation and how we may become involved in social initiatives to combat these major issues in our nation.

The Philippines' education system is in a deplorable state because of the lack of support and insufficient funding, which has led to underpaid teachers and professors, absence of a proper classroom set-up, and insufficient facilities to provide learnings such as laboratories.The Philippine Constitution required the government to allow the most significant percentage of its resources allocation of funds to education. However, among the ASEAN countries, The Philippines is still one of the poorest countries in the world. This is attributable to several factors, major political issues, and colossal difficulties that the government is mainly affected by corruption. Therefore, educational equity is lacking in locations across the country: government policies favor schools near Manila, while places far from the capital (such as Mindanao) have lower levels of student achievement.

The Philippines does not invest in high-quality education. Despite the digital era, many public schools lack computers and other equipment. A shortage of public school teachers is one of the country's most pressing challenges, owing to their status as the lowest-paid state employees. Aside from that, more than 3 million children, teenagers, and adults have been left out of school since the closure. Living in a perpetual state of crisis has long-term consequences. Misinformation, as well as poor decision-making and other societal issues, are examples of these.

Students' performance stems from different factors such as rest and sleep, mental health, and enriching activities. The majority of the education system in the Philippines usually starts at 7 a.m and usually ends around 4p.m, with the class being too early and the course being too long. It affects students' performance to focus and be productive alongside the long class hours. The class hours usually take the majority of the students' time and do not even include the homework and other activities provided by the school and its professors; this, in turn, affects the rest and after-school activities of students, which leads to a conflict of schedule. Although students spending more time in school does not equate to being educated, recent studies show increased pressure and stress on students' well being.

**Statement of the Problem**

This research aims to look at the education systems of the Philippines during the pandemic and compare them to pre-pandemic eras. This study aims to determine the following:

1. The number of students, State Universities, and  Colleges per region.
2. The statistics of enrollment and graduates in State Universities and Colleges.
3. The statistical change as schools in the Philippines shift from face-to-face classes to online learning. 
4. The number of enrolled and graduated students by discipline group.

Academics should be a priority in school because education is an efficient requirement to achieve their goals. However, students need to learn how to balance their academic and social lives. Having an equal part in academics, extracurricular activities, and socialization is the right approach to excelling at school. It also makes students happier and helps them form real-life skills through interactions with other people. It is time we rethink our educational system to give students enough time to pursue various interests and learn the tools they need to become productive citizens.

**Significance of the proposed project**

This project is essential, especially for the education of every human being, their educational attainment, and significant specialization.

- To the Students, this study explains the importance of education to help them transition to the new normal. This includes the percentage of the students enrolled and studying.

- To the Teachers, this study shall include the shifting of teaching from in-person to online classes and how the teaching pattern and techniques can be improved so that the students can quickly adapt.

- To the Government (CHED, DepEd), this study shall seek the help of the government officials in facilitating schools on how to implement new learning strategies effectively. 

- To the Community, this study shall helps enlighten them in the situation faced by educators and students.

**Methods**

The researcher will be using the datasets provided by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to analyze the statistics of enrollment and graduates in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and by discipline group. This study will conduct a series of comparisons between the variables set out in the statement of the problems. The first objective of this report is to examine the data available. The second objective is to provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison of the education systems during the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras. This study will also provide insight into areas that need attention due to identified deficiencies in the education system. This analysis aims to identify problems and shortcomings in education in the Philippines and consider potential solutions. The data collected will be reviewed to clearly understand the teachers' and students' contexts. A scenario analysis using scenario building was conducted due to this information, which identified the key strategic actions for teaching and learning continuity that needed to be taken.


**Expected output**
 
The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the world in unthinkable ways. Looking back over the last two years and the devastating effects of the pandemic that continues today, it is clear that one of the devastated areas was education. Neither the world nor educational institutions were prepared to welcome the rapid move to digital platforms. 
 
The purpose of this study is to develop fact-based data that will be utilized to properly comprehend the pre-pandemic education and today, and  its impact on learning. This project aims to improve the data collected and simplify the data into easier-to-digest information. We were able to provide information on enrolled students and graduates from 2017 to 2020 and by their discipline group. It will serve as evidence to support better educational curriculum and practices, resulting in a greater enrollment rate. We've utilized the number of college students, especially those who have been exposed to alternative learning, as a foundation for our new educational system. This is because these students are more experienced and can adapt to adjust to the new educational system. This approach to a new educational system addresses various issues, including the provision of high-quality teaching which is not just an end in itself, but also a means to other worthwhile goals. This will also give a better picture on the effects, causes, and potential solutions to the education system in the Philippines. Based on the data gathered, the proponents will create policies and suggestions for an action plan to help enhance the current educational system. The findings address statistical shifts when schools in the Philippines transition from face-to-face to online classes. It will provide conclusions and recommendations, primarily to the government and students.

**Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the Project**

The SDG that this project aims to attain is Quality Education. This SDG is further described as follows:

Goal 4: Quality Education: aspires to guarantee inclusive and equitable quality education and develop lifelong learning opportunities for everyone.

Our SDG is aligned with the comparative analysis between pre-pandemic education and today and its impact on learning. It will provide detailed information and a basis for a better education system. This framework will help the Philippine government address and comply with the lapses of the current educational system and its lack of quality education.
